#Program 1 â€“ Timesheet
#Description:   Design and write a program that accepts the number of hours worked on 
#               each of five work days from the user, then displays different 
#               information calculated about those entries as output.

# took me forever to remember that functions go OUTSIDE the main function 
# gave them an underscore to create an empty perameter knowing with in the code it would refer to the list of the same name
